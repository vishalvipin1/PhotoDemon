'This tool allows the user to apply arbitrary perspective to an image.  The code is fairly involved linear
' algebra, as a series of equations must be solved to generate the homography matrix used for the transform.
' For a more detailed explanation of the math and theory behind projective transforms, please visit:
'
' https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homography
'
'As with all distorts, reverse-mapping plus supersampling is supported for high-quality antialiasing.
